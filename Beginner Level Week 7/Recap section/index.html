    <!-- Q1 -->
    <h2 style="color: red">
      Q1: Explain the four types of function binding in JavaScript: implicit
      binding, explicit binding, new binding, and default binding. How do they
      differ from each other?
    </h2>
    <h2 style="color: blue">
      Answer:<br />-----------<br />
      In JavaScript, this keyword binding happens in four main ways:<br />
      1- Implicit Binding – Occurs when a function is called as a method of an
      object. The this keyword refers to the object before the dot.<br />
      2- Explicit Binding – Done using .call(), .apply(), or .bind() to
      explicitly set the value of this.<br />
      3- New Binding – Happens when a function is called with the new keyword,
      creating a new object and setting this to it.<br />
      4- Default Binding – Happens when a function is called without any
      context; this defaults to the global object (window in browsers) or
      undefined in strict mode.

      Q2: What will be the output of this code and why?
    </h2>
    <h2 style="color: blue">
      Answer:<br />-----------<br />
      string <br />
      First, typeof student returns "object" because student is an object.<br />
      Then, typeof "object" returns "string" because "object" is itself a
      string.

    <!-- Q3 -->
    <h2 style="color: red">
      Q3: what the modules and what the differences between CommonJS modules and
      EJS modules?
    </h2>
    <h2 style="color: blue">
      Answer:<br />-----------<br />
      CommonJS:<br />
      1- Uses require() to import.<br />
      2- Uses module.exports to export.<br />
      3- Loads modules synchronously.<br />

      ESM: <br />
      1- Uses import statement.<br />
      2- Uses export statement.<br />
      3- Loads modules asynchronously.

    <!-- Q4 -->
    <h2 style="color: red">
      Q4: What is the purpose of "scripts" attribute in package.json?
    </h2>
    <h2 style="color: blue">
      Answer:<br />-----------<br />
      The scripts in package.json defines custom commands that can be run with
      npm run. It is used to automate tasks like starting the server, running
      tests.
